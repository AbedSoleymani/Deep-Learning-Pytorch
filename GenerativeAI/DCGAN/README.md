# DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network)
1. `DCGAN.ipynb` is a notebook implementation of DCGAN optimized for execution on Google Colab. This notebook is configured to harness GPU resources using the `cuda` device.
2. `main.py` and other modules are designed for optimal utilization of GPU resources on Apple Silicon, utilizing the `mps` (Metal Performance Shaders) device.
